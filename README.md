# 🚁 HoverRush

**HoverRush** is a retro-style browser game where players pilot a flying car through an urban canyon skyway, dodging obstacles and chasing high scores. Designed as a creative fusion of *game audio* and *future mobility*, HoverRush is part of a broader exploration of how immersive sound can shape the UX of next-gen transportation.
